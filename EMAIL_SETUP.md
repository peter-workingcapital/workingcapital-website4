# Email Setup Guide

## Problem Fixed
Your contact form was previously only logging submissions to the browser console instead of actually sending emails. This has been fixed with a complete email integration.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. API Route (`/app/api/contact/route.ts`)
- Handles form submissions securely
- Validates all required fields and email format
- Sends two emails:
  - **Business notification** to peter@workingcapitalou.com with all form details
  - **Customer confirmation** to the person who submitted the form

### 2. Updated Contact Form (`/components/ContactSection.tsx`)
- Now submits to the API route instead of just logging
- Includes proper error handling and user feedback
- Shows success/error messages to users

### 3. Email Service Integration
- Uses Resend for reliable email delivery
- Professional HTML email templates
- Automatic confirmation emails for customers

## Setup Required

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key
1. Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day free)
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Add this to .env.local
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Verify Domain (Optional but Recommended)
1. In Resend dashboard, go to "Domains"
2. Add your domain (workingcapitalou.com)
3. Follow DNS verification steps
4. This allows sending from peter@workingcapitalou.com instead of a generic address

### Step 4: Test the Form
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to your contact form
3. Submit a test form
4. Check both your email and the customer's email

## Email Templates

### Business Notification Email
- Sent to: peter@workingcapitalou.com
- Contains: All form details, company info, challenges
- Action reminder: Respond within 24 hours

### Customer Confirmation Email
- Sent to: Customer's email
- Contains: Thank you message, next steps, contact info
- Professional branding with WorkingCapital details

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Arriving
1. Check spam/junk folders
2. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is correct
3. Check Resend dashboard for delivery logs
4. Ensure domain is verified if using custom domain

### Form Errors
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all required fields are filled
3. Check network tab for API call failures

### Development vs Production
- Development: Uses local environment variables
- Production: Set environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

## Security Features
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting (handled by Resend)
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- Proper error handling without exposing internals

## Next Steps
1. Set up your Resend account and API key
2. Test the form thoroughly
3. Monitor email delivery in Resend dashboard
4. Consider setting up email analytics for form conversion tracking

## Support
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Resend dashboard for delivery logs
2. Verify your API key is correct
3. Test with a simple email first
4. Contact Resend support if needed

The contact form is now fully functional and will deliver emails to your inbox!
